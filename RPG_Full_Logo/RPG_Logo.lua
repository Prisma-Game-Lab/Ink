RPG Logo animation (based on 1280x720)
Load with the time for each animation and an optional callback:
 - t1: logo fadeIn time
 - t2: logo wait time
 - t3: logo fadeOut
 - callback: a function to be called when logo presentation is over
 
 This script calls the callback when the animation ends or when the ENTER key is pressed
 To know when it is finished from other script you can access RPG_Logo.finish
